  A privilege escalation flaw was discovered in Exim. If an attacker were
  able to gain access to the &quot;exim&quot; user, they could cause Exim to execute
  arbitrary commands as the root user. (CVE-2010-4345)

  This update adds a new configuration file, &quot;/etc/exim/trusted-configs&quot;. To
  prevent Exim from running arbitrary commands as root, Exim will now drop
  privileges when run with a configuration file not listed as trusted. This
  could break backwards compatibility with some Exim configurations, as the
  trusted-configs file only trusts &quot;/etc/exim/exim.conf&quot; and
  &quot;/etc/exim/exim4.conf&quot; by default. If you are using a configuration file
  not listed in the new trusted-configs file, you will need to add it
  manually.

  Additionally, Exim will no longer allow a user to execute exim as root with
  the -D command line option to override macro definitions. All macro
  definitions that require root permissions must now reside in a trusted
  configuration file.

  Users of Exim are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain a backported patch to correct this issue. After installing this
  update, the exim daemon will be restarted automatically.");
