  folder manipulation.

  The Red Hat SquirrelMail packages provided by the RHSA-2009:0010 advisory
  introduced a session handling flaw. Users who logged back into SquirrelMail
  without restarting their web browsers were assigned fixed session
  identifiers. A remote attacker could make use of that flaw to hijack user
  sessions. (CVE-2009-0030)
